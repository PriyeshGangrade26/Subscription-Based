# Develop the game using Unreal Engine:-
```
1. Creating the game assets
2. Programming the game mechanics
3. Designing the user interface
```

#  Build the website:-
```
1. React, Next or Angular
2. design the user interface for the website, including the login and subscription pages.
3. user authentication using a technology like OAuth or JWT - To access their subscription status.
4. Payment Gateway :- Stripe or PayPal
5. User Management System :- 
- To check subscription status
- Track the number of hours a normal user has played
```

# Cloud Infrastructure:-
```
1. Deploy the game and website on a cloud infrastructure like AWS.
2. AWS EC2 instances for running the game servers.
3. AWS S3 for storing the game assets.
```
# Load Balancing:- 
```
1. AWS Elastic Load Balancing to distribute the game server load across multiple instances.
2. The game remains responsive even during high traffic periods.
```

# Database Management:-
```
AWS RDS to store user information and game data.
```


#Cost:- 
```
1. A single EC2 instance can range from $0.02 to $2 per hour
2. In Indian rupees, A single EC2 instance can range from approximately ₹1.5 to ₹165 per hour.
```

#Cost Optimization:-
```
Tools:-
1. AWS Cost Explorer
2. AWS Trusted Advisor
3. Number of EC2 instances
4. Use AWS cost calculators to estimate the charges based on your specific requirements.

```

# Error  Description:-
 
```
1. Insufficient server resources:- Slow or unresponsive gameplay for users.
2. Poor security measures:- Data breaches or unauthorized access to user information.
3. Ineffective cost optimization:- Result in high costs for running the game servers and website.
4. Compatibility issues:- Compatibility issues with different browsers or devices.
```

# Optimize game performance:-
```
1. Using caching techniques to reduce the number of requests to the server.
2. Optimizing game code and assets to reduce CPU and memory usage.
3. Using serverless technologies like AWS Lambda to reduce server costs.
```

# AWS Lambda pricing:- 
### Number of requests and the duration of the execution.
